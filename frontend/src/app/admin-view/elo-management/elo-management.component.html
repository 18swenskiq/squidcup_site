        This tool will recalculate all player ELO ratings from scratch based on completed match history. 
        All players will start with the default ELO rating and ratings will be recalculated chronologically 
        through all completed matches.

      <h3>How ELO Recalculation Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All players start with the default ELO rating (typically 1000)</li>
        <li>Completed matches are processed in chronological order</li>
        <li>ELO changes are calculated based on team performance and individual ratings</li>
        <li>New ratings are stored and become effective immediately</li>
